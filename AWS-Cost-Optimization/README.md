# 💰 Cost Optimization Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **cost optimization strategies** to reduce cloud infrastructure expenses while maintaining performance and scalability. The implementation includes **AWS cost management techniques, resource right-sizing, and automation** using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Cost Analysis**: Uses AWS Cost Explorer & Budgets API for tracking spending.
- **Resource Right-Sizing**: Identifies underutilized EC2, RDS, and other resources.
- **Auto-Scaling & Scheduling**: Implements AWS Auto Scaling and scheduled resource shutdowns.
- **Spot & Reserved Instances**: Utilizes cost-efficient EC2 pricing models.
- **Storage Optimization**: Implements Amazon S3 lifecycle policies & EBS volume monitoring.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploys AWS resources using Terraform for consistency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Tools & Services**: AWS Cost Explorer, Budgets, EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudWatch
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Automation**: AWS Lambda, AWS CLI, Boto3 (Python SDK)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cost-optimization.git
cd cost-optimization
```
### 2️⃣ Configure AWS Credentials
Ensure AWS CLI is installed and configured:
```bash
aws configure
```
### 3️⃣ Deploy Using Terraform
```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## 📊 Cost Optimization Strategies
### 1️⃣ Right-Sizing Resources
- Identify **underutilized EC2 instances** and resize them accordingly.
- Use **AWS Compute Optimizer** to get recommendations.

### 2️⃣ Auto-Scaling & Scheduling
- Configure **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** to scale resources dynamically.
- Use AWS Lambda to **schedule on/off times** for non-production environments.

### 3️⃣ Optimizing Storage Costs
- Implement **S3 lifecycle policies** to move infrequently accessed data to **Glacier**.
- Monitor **EBS volumes** and remove unused snapshots.

### 4️⃣ Leveraging Pricing Models
- Utilize **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads.
- Purchase **Reserved Instances** for long-term cost savings.

## 🦾 Troubleshooting
### 🔍 Debugging Terraform Issues
Check Terraform logs:
```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```
### ❗ AWS API Limitations
If hitting rate limits, implement exponential backoff in API requests.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- **AI-driven cost analysis** for predictive cost trends.
- **Multi-cloud support** for GCP & Azure.
